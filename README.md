# lean-game-skeleton
A skeleton game file for use with the [Lean game maker](https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker)

## What is this?

The [Natural Number Game](http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/) was made from [this repository](https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/natural_number_game) using the [Lean game maker](https://github.com/mpedramfar/Lean-game-maker). But if anyone else wants to make a web-based Lean game then perhaps the natural number game is a bit of an intimidating place to start. Here is a completely stripped-down and much simpler game with just two worlds.
