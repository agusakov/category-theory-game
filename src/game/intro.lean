# The Real Number Game, version 1.0beta

## By Kevin Buzzard 

# What is this game?

Welcome to the real number game -- a game to help undergraduates learn analysis through Lean,
a formal proof verification system. Starting from the real numbers with its usual structure,
we develop the theory of bounds, least upper bounds and greatest lower bounds (sups and infs),
infinite sequences and infinite series. We develop the theory through problem-solving,
getting students to formalise proofs in the theory.

This game is a sequel to
<a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/" target="blank">the natural number game</a>.
The levels in the Real Number Game need to be solved using tactics. To learn how to use these tactics, I would
recommend that you first play the Natural Number Game up to at least "Advanced Proposition world". I will
not go through a careful explanation of the tactics taught by the natural number game here.

Blue nodes on the graph are ones that you are ready to enter. Grey nodes you should stay away
from -- try blue ones higher up the chain first. Green nodes are completed.

# Thanks

Many thanks to Mohammad Pedramfar, without whom this game would not exist.

The Real Number Game is brought to you by the Xena project, a project based at Imperial College London
whose aim is to get mathematics undergraduates using computer theorem provers.
Lean is a computer theorem prover being developed at Microsoft Research.
