# The Category Theory Game, version 0.1

## By Alena Gusakov

# What is this game?

Welcome to the category theory game -- a game to help undergraduates learn category theory 
through Lean, a formal proof verification system. Starting from the definition of categories,
we develop the theory of functors, natural transformations, equivalence of categories,
representable functors and the Yoneda lemma. We develop the theory through problem-solving,
getting students to formalise proofs in the theory.

This game is a sequel to
<a href="http://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~buzzard/xena/natural_number_game/" target="blank">the natural number game</a>.
The levels in the Category Theory Game need to be solved using tactics. To learn how to use these tactics, I would
recommend that you first play the Natural Number Game up to at least "Advanced Proposition world". I will
not go through a careful explanation of the tactics taught by the natural number game here.

Blue nodes on the graph are ones that you are ready to enter. Grey nodes you should stay away
from -- try blue ones higher up the chain first. Green nodes are completed.

# Thanks

Many thanks to Mohammad Pedramfar, without whom this game would not exist.

The Category Theory Game is brought to you by the Xena project, a project based at Imperial College London
whose aim is to get mathematics undergraduates using computer theorem provers.
Lean is a computer theorem prover being developed at Microsoft Research.
